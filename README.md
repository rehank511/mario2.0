# Mario2.0

With a team of 3 members programmed a new version of mario with all the original sounds and graphics but different levels. 
One new feature we added was the level creator where user could create personalized livels using given set of graphical blocks (same as original).
The level creator creates a text file using the pixels on the screen and what pixel have what kind of graphical block in it, the text file is then used to create the actaul background and added it into the system for the user to use.
